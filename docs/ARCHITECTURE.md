# Zyx Academy Architecture (vNext)

**Stack:** Next.js 16 (App Router), Drizzle ORM + SQLite (dev) / Turso (prod), Better-Auth, Gemini AI via Cloudflare AI Gateway, Pinecone + Cloudflare Vectorize (vector search), UploadThing / R2 (storage abstraction), Inngest (background jobs), Firebase Cloud Messaging (push notifs), Cloudflare Workers (vector API, realtime, diktat renderer)

---

## 1. Core Philosophy & 4-Layer Design

Every content asset exists in one of four layers, from source to student-facing product:

```
 Human Artifacts     — Original PDFs in R2 (archival/student reference only)
 Canonical Content   — Verified Markdown documents (source of truth)
 Structured Knowledge — Derived objects (KOs, assessment objects, profiles, policies)
 AI Products         — Compiled interactive assets (popovers, flashcards, quizzes, diktats)
```

- **Layer 1 — Human Artifacts**: Original PDFs uploaded to Cloudflare R2 solely for archival and student reference. AI systems do not parse them directly.
- **Layer 2 — Canonical Content**: Verified Markdown documents stored in Turso. Two types: *Learning Canonical* (`calculus_chapter_4.md`) and *Assessment Canonical* (`uts_2024.md`). These are the official academic sources of truth.
- **Layer 3 — Structured Knowledge**: Automatically extracted from Canonical Content. Includes Knowledge Objects (concept graph, flashcards, Zyra context), Assessment Objects (structured questions, difficulty, patterns), Assessment Profiles (dynamic summary metrics), and Course Policies (static teacher-defined rules).
- **Layer 4 — AI Products**: Compiled interactive assets served to students — interactive popovers, flashcards, printable diktats, quiz questions.

## 2. Content Hierarchy (Core Domain)

```
Course (courses)
 └── Chapter (chapters) — ordered by orderIndex
      ├── Knowledge Object (knowledge_objects) — typed: definition|formula|example|misconception|exercise|summary|objective|concept_overview
      │    ├── has concept (concepts) via conceptId — canonical cross-course concept
      │    │    └── localizations (concept_localizations) — id/en display names + aliases
      │    ├── belongs to MTD (master_teaching_documents) via mtdId
      │    │    └── MTD has type: "learning" | "assessment"
      │    ├── feeds into → website_materials (compiled chapter material)
      │    ├── feeds into → ai_question_bank (questions tagged to KO)
      │    ├── feeds into → flashcards (per KO flashcards)
      │    ├── feeds into → knowledge_relationships (prerequisite/related/extends graph)
      │    ├── feeds into → vector_sync_queue (Pinecone/Vectorize sync)
      │    └── feeds into → learning_events (mastery tracking)
      ├── Website Material (website_materials) — 1 per chapter, compiled from KOs
      │    └── Versions (website_material_versions) — edit history
      ├── Flashcard Set (flashcard_sets) — 1 per chapter, generated from KOs
      │    └── Flashcards (flashcards) — individual front/back cards
      ├── Diktat (diktats) — compiled PDF, references MTD
      ├── Student Progress (student_chapter_progress) — per-student unlock/completion
      ├── AI Generation Job (ai_generation_jobs) — tracks Gemini work
      └── Course Materials (course_materials) — uploaded PDFs (materi_kelas / contoh_soal)

Assessment-specific (for type="assessment" MTDs):
 └── Assessment Object (assessment_objects) — parsed from assessment canonical
      ├── questionType, difficulty, pattern, reasoningType, estimatedSteps
      ├── concepts (json array of concept references)
      └── feeds into → assessment_profiles (per-course rollup)
           └── course_policies (teacher-defined constraints)
```

### Key relations:

- **Course → Chapter → Knowledge Object (KO)**: The fundamental hierarchy. KOs are the atomic unit of knowledge.
- **Master Teaching Document (MTD)**: Source-of-truth with `type: "learning" | "assessment"`. Learning MTDs produce KOs; Assessment MTDs produce `assessment_objects`. Dual-hashing (`sourceHash`, `derivedHash`) tracks changes.
- **Chapter → Website Material**: Exactly one material per chapter, compiled from the chapter's KOs by Gemini.
- **Chapter → Flashcard Set**: Exactly one flashcard set per chapter, generated from KOs.
- **Concept** (canonical) ↔ **Concept Localizations** (id/en): A concept can span multiple courses/chapters. KOs reference concepts for cross-course mastery tracking.
- **Assessment Profile**: One per course, automatically computed from all `assessment_objects`. Drives quiz generation alongside `course_policies`.

Cloudflare Workers (deployed via wrangler):
  ├── zyx-vector-api     — Vectorize upsert/query/delete proxy
  ├── zyxrealtime         — Live quiz WebSocket/SSE server
  └── zyxacademydiktat    — Puppeteer PDF renderer (hosted on Railway)
```

### Key Production Differences from Dev

| Aspect | Development | Production |
|---|---|---|
| **Database** | SQLite file (`dev.db`) | Turso (libsql, distributed SQLite) |
| **Object Storage** | UploadThing (default) | R2 via `lib/storage/index.ts` (`STORAGE_PROVIDER_MODE`) |
| **Vector Store** | Pinecone | `VECTOR_STORE` env: `pinecone` (default), `dual`, `vectorize` |
| **AI Gateway** | Direct Gemini API | Cloudflare AI Gateway (rate limit, caching, observability) |
| **Auth URL** | `localhost:3000` | `BETTER_AUTH_URL` = production origin |
| **Diktat Renderer** | Mock PDF | Railway Puppeteer service at `DIKTAT_RENDERER_URL` |
| **Analytics** | None | Vercel Analytics + Speed Insights + Sentry |

### Feature Flags (env `FEATURE_*`)
Gradual rollout via env vars — all default to off unless set to `"1"`:
```
FEATURE_MASTERY, FEATURE_TODAY, FEATURE_EMBED, FEATURE_MISCONCEPTION,
FEATURE_REMEDIATION, FEATURE_MATERIAL_LIVE, FEATURE_FC_DIFFICULTY,
FEATURE_GRAPH, FEATURE_TUTOR_RAG, FEATURE_FEEDBACK, FEATURE_STUDY_PATH,
FEATURE_TUTOR_ANALYTICS, FEATURE_LIVE, FEATURE_REFLECTION, FEATURE_DIKTAT_AI
```

## 10. Data Flow Diagrams

### Content Creation Flow (Admin/Teacher)

```
Upload PDF/Markdown
   │
   ├──→ Admin Drive (drive_item table)
   │
   └──→ Create MTD (type: "learning" | "assessment")
         │
         ├── Canonical Validation (canonical-validator.ts)
         │    └── Fails fast if structure invalid
         │
         ├── type="learning":
         │    ├──→ KO Extraction (Gemini → knowledge_objects)
         │    │      ├──→ Generate Website Material (Gemini → markdown → AST → website_materials)
         │    │      ├──→ Generate Flashcards (Gemini → flashcard_sets → flashcards)
         │    │      ├──→ Generate Questions (Gemini + Blueprint Engine + Pedagogical Validator → ai_question_bank)
         │    │      ├──→ Generate Diktat PDF (Puppeteer → R2)
         │    │      └──→ Vector Sync (Inngest → Pinecone, namespace: "learning")
         │
         └── type="assessment":
              └──→ Assessment Extraction (Deterministic split + Gemini classification)
                     ├──→ assessment_objects + assessment_profiles
                     └──→ Vector Sync (Inngest → Pinecone, namespace: "assessment")
```

### Student Interaction Flow

```
Student
  ├── Views Material → renders website_materials (markdown + AST + term popover)
  ├── Takes Quiz → quiz_templates × assessment_profile × course_policies → ai_question_bank
  │                  → student_quiz_attempts → learning_events
  │                  → mastery recompute → daily_recommendations update
  ├── Reviews Flashcards → SM-2 scheduler → student_flashcard_progress
  ├── AI Tutor Chat → tutor-rag.ts (Pinecone similarity search, "learning" namespace)
  │                    → tutor_chat_messages → tutor_session_summaries
  └── Live Quiz → WebSocket/SSE (zyxrealtime Worker) → live_quiz_sessions → live_quiz_results
```

## 11. Dual-Hashing & Staleness

All derived assets (website_materials, flashcard_sets, diktats, ai_question_bank) track their source MTD version via a dual-hashing system:

1. **`sourceHash`**: SHA-256 of the raw MTD markdown content. Changes when the source document is edited.

2. **`derivedHash`**: SHA-256 of active KOs' key attributes (for learning) or sorted question blocks (for assessment). Only changes when structured content actually shifts.

3. **Staleness cascade**: When MTD content changes:
   - `sourceHash` and `derivedHash` are recomputed
   - If `derivedHash` matches previous value → no regeneration needed (cosmetic edit only)
   - If `derivedHash` differs → downstream assets flagged `isStale = true`
   - `sourceMtdVersion` tracks which MTD version was used for each asset

This dual approach prevents unnecessary regeneration (e.g., fixing a typo in a paragraph does not invalidate flashcards derived from the same KOs).
